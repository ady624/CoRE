 *	 6/01/2016 >>> v0.0.058.20160601 - Alpha test version - More dashboard work. Nasty stuff, really. Dashboard is built in angular.js and css3. HTML is minimal :)
 *	 5/31/2016 >>> v0.0.057.20160531 - Alpha test version - Fixed some bugs with trg_changes missing a parameter, as well as vcmd_setVariable missing a new parameter. (also introduced the Dashboard)
 *	 5/31/2016 >>> v0.0.056.20160531 - Alpha test version - Initial DTH integration of custom attributes. DTHs can describe their attributes so they become "standard" instead of "custom" in the Attribute list
 *	 5/30/2016 >>> v0.0.055.20160530 - Alpha test version - Added the repeatAction command - minimal testing done
 *	 5/30/2016 >>> v0.0.054.20160530 - Alpha test version - Enabled custom commands with simple parameters (boolean, decimal, number, string)
 *	 5/30/2016 >>> v0.0.053.20160530 - Alpha test version - Enabled simple custom commands, added predefined commands for hue: startLoop, stopLoop, setLoopTime and for Harmony: allOn, allOff, hubOn, hubOff

 *	 5/27/2016 >>> v0.0.050.20160527 - Alpha test version - Load Attribute from variable done and partially tested. Missing: color support - this is a complex data type...
 *	 5/27/2016 >>> v0.0.04f.20160527 - Alpha test version - We have an official icon! Also, fixed a problem with time scheduling for "not in between", fixed a potential problem with casting null values.
 *	 5/27/2016 >>> v0.0.04e.20160527 - Alpha test version - Implemented saveAttribute, introduced "aggregated" commands, these only run once, even when used on a list of devices
 *	 5/27/2016 >>> v0.0.04d.20160527 - Alpha test version - Fixed a bug (for good?) with item in list for is_one_of. Types enum, mode, and other special types need not be casted.
 *	 5/26/2016 >>> v0.0.04c.20160526 - Alpha test version - Fixed a bug with item in list for is_one_of.

 *	 5/26/2016 >>> v0.0.048.20160526 - Alpha test version - Conditions for capability Variable should now work. Triggers are only available for @ (global) variables, but the mechanism for subscribing to changes is not yet here. So triggers don't yet work.
 *	 5/26/2016 >>> v0.0.047.20160526 - Alpha test version - Fixed a problem with casting enums... they are now handled as strings
 *	 5/26/2016 >>> v0.0.046.20160526 - Alpha test version - Pretty major changes at conditions UI and logic. Added the ability to compare against another device/attribute pair (can choose any attribute of that device). Added the toggleLevel command and fixed some bugs with setting SHM status.
 *	 5/25/2016 >>> v0.0.045.20160525 - Alpha test version - Caching attributes - attempt to speed up some things
 *	 5/25/2016 >>> v0.0.044.20160525 - Alpha test version - Fixed the command description for custom commands - temporary until custom commands are complete

Global scope does not yet work, CoRE would have to "spread the word" to all child pistons. Improved the device condition evaluation to speed up things - took common code outside of the device loop.
 *	 5/24/2016 >>> v0.0.042.20160524 - Alpha test version - Execute Routine action is now available. Routine execution trigger not yet ready.
 *	 5/24/2016 >>> v0.0.041.20160524 - Alpha test version - Extended "is one of" and "is not one of" to attributes that have only two values. It was previously available only to those having three or more values.
 *	 5/24/2016 >>> v0.0.040.20160524 - Alpha test version - Multi sub-device support (read buttons in conditions, or multi-switch in actions). TODO: buttons & triggers - the button state does not change, so detecting a change is tricky, or rather, simpler, but different.
 *	 5/23/2016 >>> v0.0.03f.20160523 - Alpha test version - Added matching and non-matching device list variables and renamed "With (devices)" to "Using (devices)"
 *	 5/23/2016 >>> v0.0.03e.20160523 - Alpha test version - Set Variable fixes for time variables, fixed variables not being parsed in sendNotification

 *	 5/22/2016 >>> v0.0.03b.20160522 - Alpha test version - Changed hue to angle, 0-360. Fixed a problem with mode and SHM alarm triggers. Added two predefined commands: quickSetCool and quickSetHeat
 *	 5/20/2016 >>> v0.0.03a.20160520 - Alpha test version - Color support. Added all 140 standard CSS colors, plus 4 white light colors. Partially tested with Osram (Green is green and Crimson is crimson)
 *	 5/20/2016 >>> v0.0.039.20160520 - Alpha test version - Fixed an error where an incomplete (during building) time condition would fail due to next event calculation introduced in v0.0.036.20160520
 *	 5/20/2016 >>> v0.0.038.20160520 - Alpha test version - Displaying individual actions (when true) in the main piston page and showing action restrictions as per https://github.com/ady624/CoRE/issues/7
 *	 5/20/2016 >>> v0.0.037.20160520 - Alpha test version - Modified event duplication detection to only ignore identical events received within one second of each other, or events generated before the last event was generated. Also enabled {$variable} support in notification messages. "Time is {$now}" will return the time... :)
 *	 5/20/2016 >>> v0.0.036.20160520 - Alpha test version - Optimized time condition evaluation for next event time - limitations: events only happen at designated times, with no regards to any existing time restrictions (i.e. will trigger an event on Fri even if Fri is restricted - the evaluation at that time, however, will take restrictions into account)
 *	 5/19/2016 >>> v0.0.035.20160519 - Alpha test version - Fixed a problem where custom time in a "between" condition would reset the offset for sunrise/sunset
 *	 5/19/2016 >>> v0.0.034.20160519 - Alpha test version - Notification support. Push/SMS/Notification. Coming soon: variable support in message.
 *	 5/19/2016 >>> v0.0.033.20160519 - Alpha test version - Location Mode and SHM status now trigger events
 *	 5/19/2016 >>> v0.0.032.20160519 - Alpha test version - Added delayed turn on, off and toggle

 *	 5/18/2016 >>> v0.0.02f.20160518 - Alpha test version - Minor bug fixes - including time condition scheduling, unscheduling of all event tasks prior to rescheduling (deleting a time trigger left the schedule behind)
 *	 5/18/2016 >>> v0.0.02e.20160518 - Alpha test version - Broken debugging mode down into several levels, info, trace, debug, warn and error. Fixed display of device names where device has no label.
 *	 5/18/2016 >>> v0.0.02d.20160518 - Alpha test version - Time conditions now act as triggers if no triggers are involved in any of the condition sets - this is to mimic the way device act as triggers when the same applies
 *	 5/17/2016 >>> v0.0.02c.20160517 - Alpha test version - Fixed time not between
 *	 5/17/2016 >>> v0.0.02b.20160517 - Alpha test version - Individual actions...
